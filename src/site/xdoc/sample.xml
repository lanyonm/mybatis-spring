      <p>
      	JPetStore 6 is a full web application built on top of MyBatis 3, 
      	<a href="http://www.springsource.org">Spring 3</a> and <a href="http://www.stripesframework.org/">Stripes</a>.
        If is available for download in the 
        <a href="http://mybatis.googlecode.com/svn/sub-projects/mybatis-spring/trunk/src/test/java/org/mybatis/spring/sample/">downloads</a>
        section of MyBatis project site.
        In this section we will walk through this sample to understand how is it built and learn how to run it. 
      </p>
      <subsection name="Purpose">
      	<p>
      	This new JPetStore comes with the same idea in mind than for its predecessors: <strong>keep it simple</strong>. The main purpose behind JPetStore 6 
      	is to demonstrate that a full web application can be built with just a few classes, and what is more important, with no advanced coding 
      	skills. You just need to know plain Java and SQL.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      	The 6th version of JPetStore is the smallest one in the family. It uses just 24 java classes while keeping good design and program structure. 
      	As we will see a bit later, you will not find jdbc code, object creation, binding code or transaction handling code. What is more 
      	impressive is that you <strong>will not even find any call to the MyBatis API</strong>. Although this sounds magical, you will se that the 
      	combination of MyBatis mappers and dependency injection lets you build applications with no dependency on MyBatis.     
      	</p> 
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Program Structure">
      	<p> JpetStore 6 follows the typical maven project structure </p>

      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Configuration files">
      <p>
      Configuration files are read during application startup. Their purpose is to configure the three
      frameworks composing the application: Stripes, Spring and MyBatis. We will just need to configure
      two files: web.xml and applicationContext.xml.
      </p>
      <h4>web.xml</h4>
      <p>
      First af all we need to start Stripes, so we follow the Stripes manual to do so. The manual says that
      we should set up a Dispatcher servlet and a filter. So let's go. 
      </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<filter>
	<display-name>Stripes Filter</display-name>
	<filter-name>StripesFilter</filter-name>
	<filter-class>net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.StripesFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
	<filter-name>StripesFilter</filter-name>
	<servlet-name>StripesDispatcher</servlet-name>
	<dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
</filter-mapping>
<servlet>
	<servlet-name>StripesDispatcher</servlet-name>
	<servlet-class>net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
	<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>StripesDispatcher</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>*.action</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
]]></source>      

	<p>Stripes is able to search for ActionBean classes, for that purpose we must set up the
	base package it should search in.</p>

<source><![CDATA[
	<filter-class>net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.StripesFilter</filter-class>
	<init-param>
		<param-name>ActionResolver.Packages</param-name>
		<param-value>org.mybatis.jpetstore.web</param-value>
	</init-param>
	</filter>
]]></source>      

	<p>We are done with Stripes. Let's move on to the Spring side. According to Spring's reference manual 
	we should add a Context listener to start up Spring. So let's add it</p>

<source><![CDATA[
	<listener>
		<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
]]></source>      

	<p>By default Spring will use <code>/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml</code> if we don't specify 
	a different file. The default is fine for us.
	</p>

	<p>Now we have to let Stripes know that it will be running with Spring. This way we will be able
	to inject Spring beans directly into Stripes ActionBeans. For that purpose, following once 
	again the Stripes manual, we set up an interceptor as follows below:
	</p>

<source><![CDATA[
	<filter-class>net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.StripesFilter</filter-class>
		...
		<init-param>
			<param-name>Interceptor.Classes</param-name>
			<param-value>
		        net.sourceforge.stripes.integration.spring.SpringInterceptor
		    </param-value>
		</init-param>
	</filter>
    ...
]]></source>      
      
      <p>We are done with web.xml. As you may have notice, we have not set up any MyBatis 3 configuration yet.
      That configuration goes into the Spring's applicationContext.xml that we will see in the following
      section.
      </p>
      
      <h4>applicationContext.xml</h4>
      <p>As you already know applicationContext.xml is the Spring's configuration file. Spring is a dependency 
      injection framework and it has to know which beans it must create and how to bind them together and that is
      what applicationContext.xml file is for. Let's have a deeper look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
      The first and easiest thing we have to do is let Spring know where are our service beans. We will let Spring
      search them in our classpath so we just need to provide it the base package to search in:
      </p>
      
<source><![CDATA[
    <context:component-scan base-package="org.mybatis.jpetstore.service" />
]]></source>

	  <p>
	  <span class="label important">NOTE</span> Spring's component scan feature is not able to find MyBatis mappers.
	  A mapper is not a plain bean and Spring would not know how to instantiate it. We will need a 
	  <code>MapperScannerConfigurer</code> for that, as we will see soon.
	  </p> 
	  
	  <p>We will also need a <code>DataSource</code> and a <code>TransactionManager</code>. Given that this is a demo application
	  we will use a test Spring <code>DataSource</code> that will create an HSQL in-memory database and load
	  our database scripts into it. We will also use the standard Spring's <code>DataSourceTransactionManager</code>
	  to handle transactions. 
	  </p>

<source><![CDATA[
   <jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource">
       <jdbc:script location="classpath:database/jpetstore-hsqldb-schema.sql"/>
       <jdbc:script location="classpath:database/jpetstore-hsqldb-dataload.sql"/>
   </jdbc:embedded-database>

   <bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
       <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
   </bean>
]]></source>
	  	  
	  <p>So far, all we have done is standard Stripes and Spring configuration and now it is time to 
	  move on to the MyBatis part. As you have learned in this manual to set up MyBatis with Spring you need
	  at least two things: an <code>SqlSessionFactoryBean</code> and a mapper class. So let's go hands on. 
	  First define a <code>SqlSessionFactoryBean</code>:
	  </p>     

<source><![CDATA[
    <bean id="sqlSessionFactory" class="org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean">
        <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
    </bean>
]]></source>

      <p>And now we need to setup our mappers. For that purpose we will use the <code>MapperScannerConfigurer</code>
      that works similar to Spring standard component scan. It will search our classpath for mapper clases
      and register them to MyBatis. Similar to Spring's component scan we must configure the base
      package to search in. 
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
    <bean class="org.mybatis.spring.mapper.MapperScannerConfigurer">
        <property name="basePackage" value="org.mybatis.jpetstore.persistence" />
    </bean>
]]></source>
      
      <p>To save some writing when building our mapper xml files we would want to be able to use short 
      aliases for beans. The <code>SqlSessionFactoryBean</code> has the capability to search for beans and 
      register their short names as aliases if we setup the <code>typeAliasPackage</code> property like
      the following
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
    <bean id="sqlSessionFactory" class="org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean">
        <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
        <property name="typeAliasesPackage" value="org.mybatis.jpetstore.domain" />
    </bean>
]]></source>

		<p>Our application is now fully configured and ready to run. But before running it lets have a tour 
		through the code to see how it looks like.
		</p>      
      
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Code tour">
      <p>JPetStore is a typical MVC application with three layers: presentation, logic and data access.
      </p>
      <h4>Presentation</h4>
      <p>The presentation layer is composed by JSP files and Stripes ActionBeans. JSPs just use plain HTML, 
      JSTL tags and Stripes tags so there is nothing especial about them for the sake of this sample. Stripes
      ActionBeans are like Struts actions or Spring MVC controllers so there is nothing especial with them either.  
      </p>
      <p>Given that we have integrated Stripes with Spring, we can inject our services into our BeanActions so
      you can just use them without caring about its creation or lookup. 
      Have a look at <code>CatalogActionBean</code>:</p>

<source><![CDATA[
@SessionScope
public class CatalogActionBean extends AbstractActionBean {
  ...
  @SpringBean
  private transient CatalogService catalogService;
  ...
  public ForwardResolution viewCategory() {
    if (categoryId != null) {
      productList = catalogService.getProductListByCategory(categoryId);
      category = catalogService.getCategory(categoryId);
    }
    return new ForwardResolution(VIEW_CATEGORY);
  }
  ...  
]]></source>

	  <p>Note the <code>@SpringBean</code> annotation, that is an Stripes annotation that tells Stripes to
	  look for that bean in Spring and inject it into this ActionBean.</p>

      <h4>Logic</h4>
      <p>Application logic is composed by plain Java beans that act as services and plain Java beans that
      act as domain objects. This layer is in charge of filling domain objects with database data and 
      updating database data with the content of the domain objects. For this purpose this layer must be
      transactional, that is, it must be able to perform atomic database updates. 
      </p>
      <p>Let's have a look at <code>OrderService</code> code to see how all this is achieved:
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
@Service
public class OrderService {

  @Autowired
  private ItemMapper itemMapper;
  @Autowired
  private OrderMapper orderMapper;
  @Autowired
  private LineItemMapper lineItemMapper;

  @Transactional
  public void insertOrder(Order order) {
    order.setOrderId(getNextId("ordernum"));
    for (int i = 0; i < order.getLineItems().size(); i++) {
      LineItem lineItem = (LineItem) order.getLineItems().get(i);
      String itemId = lineItem.getItemId();
      Integer increment = new Integer(lineItem.getQuantity());
      Map<String, Object> param = new HashMap<String, Object>(2);
      param.put("itemId", itemId);
      param.put("increment", increment);
      itemMapper.updateInventoryQuantity(param);
    }

    orderMapper.insertOrder(order);
    orderMapper.insertOrderStatus(order);
    for (int i = 0; i < order.getLineItems().size(); i++) {
      LineItem lineItem = (LineItem) order.getLineItems().get(i);
      lineItem.setOrderId(order.getOrderId());
      lineItemMapper.insertLineItem(lineItem);
    }
  }
]]></source>
      
      <p>The first thing you will notice is that there is no JDBC code in your service, 
      nor it is any MyBatis code in it. You may think that we used the 
      DAO pattern and database access code is in the database layer, but as we will see later,   
      the database layer is built with MyBatis mappers, that are plain java
      interfaces, and that is why <strong>you will not find any call to MyBatis API</strong> 
      in the whole application. It is just not needed.</p>
      
      <p>The second thing you may have noticed is that there are no commits or rollbacks.
      That is because it uses the declarative transaction demarcation feature of Spring that is 
      fully supported by MyBatis-Spring. 
      The Spring's <code>@Transactional</code> annotation indicates that this method is transactional, 
      that means that all <code>updateInventoryQuantity</code>, <code>insertOrder</code> and 
      <code>insertLineItem</code> mapper calls must succeed or none one.</p>
      
      <h4>Persistence</h4>
      <p>The persistence layer is composed of MyBatis mappers. Mappers are just plain Java
      interfaces and mapper xml files containing the SQL statements. 
      There is no custom Java code in this layer. When the 
      <code>getOrder</code> method is called on the <code>OrderMapper</code> interface, 
      MyBatis will execute the getOrder SQL statement in OrderMapper.xml file and
      will populate the <code>Order</code> domain bean with retrieved data.
      </p> 

<source><![CDATA[
public interface OrderMapper {

  List<Order> getOrdersByUsername(String username);

  Order getOrder(int orderId);
  
  void insertOrder(Order order);
  
  void insertOrderStatus(Order order);

}]]></source>      

<source><![CDATA[
<mapper namespace="org.mybatis.jpetstore.persistence.OrderMapper">

  <cache />

  <select id="getOrder" resultType="Order" parameterType="int">
    select
      BILLADDR1 AS billAddress1,
      BILLADDR2 AS billAddress2,
      BILLCITY,
      BILLCOUNTRY,
      BILLSTATE,
      BILLTOFIRSTNAME,
      BILLTOLASTNAME,
      BILLZIP,
      SHIPADDR1 AS shipAddress1,
      SHIPADDR2 AS shipAddress2,
      SHIPCITY,
      SHIPCOUNTRY,
      SHIPSTATE,
      SHIPTOFIRSTNAME,
      SHIPTOLASTNAME,
      SHIPZIP,
      CARDTYPE,
      COURIER,
      CREDITCARD,
      EXPRDATE AS expiryDate,
      LOCALE,
      ORDERDATE,
      ORDERS.ORDERID,
      TOTALPRICE,
      USERID AS username,
      STATUS
    FROM ORDERS, ORDERSTATUS
    WHERE ORDERS.ORDERID = #{value}
      AND ORDERS.ORDERID = ORDERSTATUS.ORDERID
  </select>
  ...
</mapper>
]]></source>      

      <p>
      <span class="label important">NOTE</span> 
      You can easily add caching to your queries by adding a &lt;cache /&gt; element to your 
      mapper xml file. Or, if you prefer, Spring lets you cache at a higher level, caching the 
      whole call to a mapper or service method.
      </p>
      
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Running JPetStore">
      <p>You may ask. Does all this work? Yes it does!. Let's run it.</p>
