  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
    MyBatis-Spring helps you integrate your MyBatis code seamlessly with
    Spring. Using the classes in this library, Spring will load the necessary
    MyBatis factory and session classes for you. This library also provides
    an easy way to inject MyBatis data mappers into your service beans.
    Finally, MyBatis-Spring will handle transactions and translate MyBatis
    exceptions into Spring DataAccessExceptions.
  </para>

  <section id="getting_started.installation">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>
      To use the MyBatis-Spring module, you just need to include the
      <literal>mybatis-spring-<?eval ${project.version}?>.jar</literal> 
      file and its dependencies in the classpath.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using Maven just add the following dependency
      to your pom.xml:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mybatis</groupId>
  <artifactId>mybatis-spring</artifactId>
  <version>]]><?eval ${project.version}?><![CDATA[</version>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="getting_started.setup">
    <title>Quick Setup</title>
    <para>
      To use MyBatis with Spring you need at least two things defined in the
      Spring application context: an <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> and
      at least one data mapper class.
    </para>

    <para>
      In MyBatis-Spring, an <literal>SqlSessionFactoryBean</literal> is used to
      create an <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal>. To configure the
      factory bean, put the following in the Spring XML configuration file:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="sqlSessionFactory" class="org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean">
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Notice that the <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> requires a
      DataSource. This can be any DataSource and should be configured just like
      any other Spring database connection.
    </para>

   <para>
      Assume you have a data mapper class defined like the following:

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public interface UserMapper {
  @Select("SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = #{userId}")
  User getUser(@Param("userId") String userId);
} ]]></programlisting>

      This interface is added to Spring using a
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> like the following:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<![CDATA[<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.MapperFactoryBean">
  <property name="mapperInterface" value="org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>

      Note that the mapper class specified <emphasis>must</emphasis> be an
      interface, not an actual implementation class. In this example,
      annotations are used to specify the SQL, but a MyBatis mapper XML file
      could also be used.
    </para>

    <para>
       Once configured, you can inject mappers directly into your
       business/service objects in the same way you inject any other Spring
       bean. The <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> handles creating an
       <literal>SqlSession</literal> as well as closing it. If there is a Spring transaction in
       progress, the session will also be committed or rolledback when the
       transaction completes. Finally,any exceptions will be translated into
       Spring <literal>DataAccessException</literal>s.
     </para>

     <para>
       Calling MyBatis data methods is now only one line of code:
       <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[User user = userMapper.getUser(userId);]]></programlisting>
     </para>

  </section>
