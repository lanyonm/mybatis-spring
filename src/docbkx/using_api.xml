        <para>
            You can also use directly MyBatis API. In this case you won't have any MyBatis-Spring Dependency and you
            simply use a injected <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> on your DAOs:
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class UserMapperSqlSessionImpl implements UserMapper {

    private SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory;

    public void setSqlSessionFactory(SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory) {
        this.sqlSessionFactory = sqlSessionFactory;
    }

    public User getUser(String userId) {
        SqlSession session = sqlSessionFactory.openSession();
        User user = (User) session.selectOne("sample.UserMapper.getUser", userId);
        session.close();
        return user;
    }

}]]></programlisting>
            This scenario also supports transaction but ther will be no exception translation.
