    <title>What is MyBatis-Spring?</title>
    <para>
      MyBatis-Spring helps you integrate your MyBatis code seamlessly with
      Spring. Using the classes in this library, Spring will load the necessary
      MyBatis factory and session classes for you. This library also provides
      an easy way to inject MyBatis data mappers and <literal>SqlSession</literal>s
      into your service beans. It will also handle transactions and translate MyBatis
      exceptions into Spring <literal>DataAccessException</literal>s.
      Finally, it will let you build your application code free of 
      dependencies on MyBatis, Spring or MyBatis-Spring.

    <title>Motivation</title>
    <para>
      Spring version 2 only supports iBATIS version 2. An attempt was made to
      add MyBatis 3 support into Spring 3.0 (see the Spring Jira 
      <ulink url="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5991">issue</ulink>).
      Unfortunately, Spring 3.0 development ended before MyBatis 3.0 was
      officially released. Because the Spring team did not want to release with
      code based on a non-released version of MyBatis, official Spring support
      would have to wait. Given the interest in Spring support for MyBatis, 
      the MyBatis community decided it was time to reunite the interested contributors 
      and add Spring integration as a community sub-project of MyBatis instead.

    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Before starting with MyBatis-Spring integration, it is very important
      that you are familiar with both MyBatis and Spring terminology. This
      document does not attempt to provide background information or basic
      setup and configuration tutorials for either MyBatis or Spring.
    </para>
    <para>
      Like MyBatis and Spring 3.0, MyBatis-Spring requires Java 5 or higher.

    <title>Acknowledgements</title>
    <para>
      A special thanks goes to all the special people who made this project
      a reality (in alphabetical order): Eduardo Macarron, Hunter Presnall 
      and Putthibong Boonbong for the coding, testing and documentation; 
      Andrius Juozapaitis, Giovanni Cuccu, Raj Nagappan and Tomas Pinos 
      for their contributions; and Simone Tripodi for finding everyone and
      bringing them all back to the project under MyBatis ;) Without them,
      this project wouldn't exist.
