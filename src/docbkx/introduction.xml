        <title>Why mybatis-spring - Motivation</title>
        <para>
            In our daily work we've been strongly using both
            <ulink url="http://www.mybatis.org/">MyBatis Sql Mapper</ulink> and
            <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google Guice</ulink>
            frameworks and once noticed we'd been continuosly repeating the same
            code snippets in different projects, according to the DRY
            <emphasis>don't repeat yourself</emphasis> principle, we started
            realizing something that alleviate us the task to create our stuff.

            Indeed, this small library intends to create the missing perfect glue
            between the two popular frameworks, reducing the boilerplate and
            redundant code that users have to write to configure and use MyBatis
            into a Spring 3.X context.

        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>
            Before starting reading the manual, it is very important you're
            familiar with both MyBatis and Spring framework and therminology,
            otherwise it would be very difficult to understand the described context.
        </para>
        <para>
            Like MyBatis, mybatis-spring requires Java 5 or higher.
        </para>

        <title>Acknowledgements</title>
        <para>
            A special thanks goes to all the special people who made this project
            a reality, above all (in alphabetical order) Andrius Juozapaitis,
            Eduardo Maccarron, Hunter Presnall, Putthibong Boonbong and Raj Nagappan.
            Without them, that project wouldn't exist.
