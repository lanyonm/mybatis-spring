    <title>Injecting Mappers</title>
    <para>
      Mybatis-spring lets you inject mappers into your service
      beans. When using mappers you simply call your
      mappers as you have always called your DAOs, but this time you wonÂ´t need 
      to code any DAO implementation because MyBatis will do it for you. 
    </para>
    <para>
      With injected mappers your code will have no mybatis-spring dependencies and no MyBatis dependencies either.
    </para>

      We have this simple mapper in our application. As you know a mapper is just an interface:
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface UserMapper {
    User getUser(String userId);
}]]>
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      This is the way you set up this mapper with mybatis-spring:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.MapperFactoryBean">
    <property name="sqlSessionFactory" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
    <property name="mapperInterface" value="sample.UserMapper" />
</bean>]]>
      </programlisting>
      When using mappers you don't need to set up mapper list on the <literal>mybatis-config.xml</literal> file
      because mappers are able to register themselves to MyBatis during startup.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now your mapper is ready to be injected on your service objects:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean id="fooService" class="sample.FooServiceImpl">
    <property name="userMapper" ref="userMapper" />
</bean>]]>
      </programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>
</chapter>
