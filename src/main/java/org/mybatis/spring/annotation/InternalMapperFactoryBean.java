/**
* MapperScanner registers new mappers creating new MapperFactoryBeans 
* but if there are other MapperFactoryBeans defined in the context their 
* BeanDefinitions are created before the MapperScanner is executed. 
* It seems that the MapperFactoryBean's bean definition created by the MapperScanner 
* is not the same that the one created by Spring. That makes autowire fail and Spring 
* will throw an Exception indicating that a either sqlSessionFactory or sqlSessionTemplate 
* is null and its required.
* <p>
* Seems that the problem is solved if another factory bean class is registered
* because bean definitions will be different and will not collide.
* <p> 
* So this class just extends MapperFactoryBean and does nothing more.
* <p> 
* This class is only for the MapperScanner and should never be used by final users.
